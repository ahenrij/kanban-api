Get started testing the routes by importing this [Postman Collection](https://www.getpostman.com/collections/07b2f834ed3d99eed13a). 
You will need to create an environment with two variables :

* __url__: http://localhost:8090/api
* __access_token__: (empty) - the access token is filled automatically right after login request succeeded.

Note that all routes except those for authentication (__login__ and __register__), require the access token from __login__ response,
as Bearer Token in Authorization Header, to add a security layer to the API and ease getting the current user making a request.\
The access token is a Json Web Token (JWT).
